# Final-Rest

Hello!

I'm a hobby programmer with no formal computer science education. I like figuring things out and hopefully I'll be able to learn enough to make this game something cool! If you have suggestions for me, let me know. Any advice, especially from experienced programmers, is appreciated.

Have fun playing!
